Heroin is arguably the most destructive and problematic drug to the human race. While drug abuse runs rampant across the globe, few other drugs can compare with the magnitude of heroin. An addictive, deadly, and popular drug, it transcends barriers of region, age, race and class. Lives are lost and societies are ravaged as heroin use and production continues to grow.
</p>

<p>
Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is an opioid analgesic (painkiller) that can be smoked, snorted and injected. The drug attracts initial users with the appeal of overwhelming physical euphoria, and seizes addicts with the threat of horrific, deadly withdrawal symptoms. Users build tolerance to the drug and require greater quantities to maintain their habit. The demand for potent, and therefore deadly heroin is always growing. Fatal overdoses are shockingly common among addicts.
</p>

<h3>Who Uses Heroin?</h3>

<p>
Many envision addicts as impoverished transients from low-income neighborhoods. In reality, heroin use is growing in popularity among suburban, middle-class individuals in the U.S. 

The prominence of narcotic painkillers in America has spawned a new generation of addicts. Heroin use is not restricted to certain demographics. Surprisingly, recent data reveals that the percentage of white heroin users is greater than the percentage of white individuals in the overall U.S. population.

<h3>Race Distribution</h3>

<script src="js/hrace.js"></script>
<h3>Age Distribution</h3>
<p>
Heroin addiction claims lives quickly. The life expectancy of heroin users continues to decrease. The skewed age distribution is a testament to the increase in the supply and demand of potent (deadly) heroin.

<h3>Users by Frequency of Use</h3>
<p>
By a staggering majority, most users are chronic users. The fate of most users is to eventuate as an addict. 
<br>
<span style="font-size:12px;"><i>* Chronic use is defined as using more than ten days per month.</i></span>

<h3>Yearly Heroin Overdoses by Gender</h3>

This chart shows the number of deaths resulting from heroin overdose in the U.S. While most users are male, popularity increases among females while the overall rate of overdoses grows.

<h3>Prevalence of Opiate (Heroin and Opium-Derived) Use (Ages 12-70):</h3>
<p>
This map shows the percentage of population that use opiates (heroin and opium-derived substances) in each country. Over 80% of the world's heroin is produced in Afghanistan, which is trafficked by land, sea, and air to the rest of the world. Bolivia is a major trafficking hub for the West.
