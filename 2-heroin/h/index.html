	<h2>Heroin: A Scourge on Society</h2>

	<h2>Project Overview</h2><hr>

	<p>
		Project 2 will visualize data relating to the chemical diacetylmorphine, more commonly known as "heroin." The project aims to divulge trends in consumption, demographics of use, geographic trends (with focus on the U.S.), death toll and other relevant data. The idea is to give the audience an article that they can read in 10-15 minutes and have a good understanding of the issue at hand.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Style</h3>
	
	<p>
		Due to the nature its subject matter, this project strives for seriousness. Stylistic components will be restained for the most part, though creative flair may emerge where necessary. Graphical components will focus on function rather than form. The style should tell a story accurately while presenting data in a meaningful, comprehensible format.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Client</h3>
	
	<p>
		The client would ideally be an NGO. Some that come to mind are:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/data/">SAMHSA</a> (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration)</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/">CDC</a> (Center for Disease Control)</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.drugabuse.gov/">NIDA</a> (National Institute on Drug Abuse)</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dca">BJS</a> (Bureau of Justice Statistics)</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2012.html">UNODC</a> (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime)
			</li>
		</ul>

		These will also serve as key data sources as they publish major reports regarding crime, drug abuse, and mental health issues.

		The graphic is intended to present readers with educational information that reveals the devastating societal damage caused by the production and consumption of heroin.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Format</h3>
	
	<p>
		This story will exist as a webpage with charts, maps, and possibly interactive components (depending on availability of data).

	<h3>Consumption, Production, and Transportation</h3>
	<p>
	This section will contain key statistics and information that illustrates the volume of the heroin market. Much of this information is available from a <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2014/World_Drug_Report_2014_web.pdf">report</a> published by the UNODC.
